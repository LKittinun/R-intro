Want to work with MS files yourself but do not have access to licensed software? No worries! These days, a lot of free-to-use proteomics tools (academic use mostly) are now available for mass spectrometry data analysis. However, not all programs can analyze native file extensions from different instrument vendors, such as `.raw`, `.wiff`, or `.d`. Luckily, the awesome proteomics community has created standardized file formats like `.mzML` and `.mzXML`, which enable cross-platform analysis. Even luckier, there is a tool that lets you convert vendor-specific extensions to these open formats!

**Download now** \>\> [ProteoWizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html){target="_blank"} (nope, not sponsored)

It works on all major platforms; choose it at your own will. After download, just install normally. You will also installed SeeMS software that can visualize your `.mzML` file.

MSConvert comes with both a GUI and a command line version, here is a list of [supported format](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/doc_users.html#SupportedFormats){target="_blank"}. The GUI version looks like this.

![](data/msconvert.png)

To convert files, choose your desire files and output directory. Then tick everything as in the figure and you are good to go. To add a little explanation:

\- `peakPicking` does centroid the spectrum for you. The 1- means you do it at MS1 level.

\- `zeroSamples removeExtra` Remove any zero data. This helps reduce file size, as .mzML normally has a larger file size than vendor-specific files.

For someone who loves the command line. You can run it by locating `msconvert.exe` file in the installed folder and executing it. You can also add them to `PATH` for more convenience. These are some of the commands I normally use, note that I use PowerShell in this setting. You can change to your platform, which should not be difficult anyway, or just ask [Mr. Sam Altman](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/){target="_blank"} to convert the format for you.

### All files in the folder

`-v` stands for verbose. I recommend adding this argument, as it will allow you to track the progress of the conversion.

```         
msconvert *.raw `
  --filter "peakPicking true 1-" `
  --mzML --64 --zlib -o .\yourfolder -v 
```

### Specific files, e.g. first 10 files

In this case, we have to do it in loop.

```         
(gci | Select-Object -first 10).BaseName | 
  foreach {msconvert $_ --filter "peakPicking true 1-" --mzML --64 --zlib -o .\mzML -v} 
```

### Demultiplex

If by any chance you have data with staggered windows, you also need to demultiplex it.

```         
msconvert *.raw `
  --filter "peakPicking true 1-" `
  --filter "zeroSamples removeExtra" `
  --filter "demultiplex optimization=overlap_only" `
  --mzML --64 --zlib `
  -o .\yourfolder -v 
```

Happy analyzing!
